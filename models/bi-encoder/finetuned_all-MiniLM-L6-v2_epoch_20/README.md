    you be required to buy two tickets[BODY]pas i said in another question im bringing
    my parents to visit me here in sweden next yearppmy mother is around 280300 pounds
    and 56 130135kg 167m i am concerned that she might be asked at the airport to
    buy a second seat if its likely i would rather just buy the second seat in advance
    because i dont want her to be embarassedhumiliated by some random employee as
    well i wont be there they will be travelling alone and arent used to dealing with
    airports and they wont know what their rights areppin terms of how it will affect
    other passengers its not important she will get a window seat and my dad will
    sit in the middle seat so i dont see it affecting anybody ppshe insists its fine
    the last time i flew i fit easily but that was 20 years ago when she was half
    the size ppthey will be flying ba or sas definitely not ryanairppso  where is
    the cutoff is a 300 pound 56 woman going to be too big to fit in a single airline
    seat or am i worrying about nothingp'
  sentences:
  - those things which i also often forget have something in common they are out of
    sight and out of mind  and easy to overlook especially when in a hurry the toiletries
    are probably in the bathroom maybe under a towel or in the shower behind a fold
    of the shower curtain and its easy to forget to look there or to miss a spot the
    adapter is wherever the plug is probably under a table often somewhere awkward
    to get to as a backup it helps to have a fixed space in your bags or pockets for
    such easytomiss items so that even if on your 3rd sweep of the room you didnt
    properly look under the damp towel in the bathroom or behind the cabinet where
    the only usable plug was youll notice the item is missing because the space for
    it in your bag or pockets is conspicuously empty side pockets of bags are great
    for this because you can just pat them to check they feel right just dont put
    valuables there if youre going somewhere with a pickpocketing problem if your
    luggage doesnt have compartments like this eg a trundle suitcase that is just
    one big compartment you could consider things like packing cubes which wont fit
    together as expected if one is missing or underfilled  especially sets that are
    different sizes and colours image from httpswwwwikihowcompackwithpackingcubes
  - kayak has a direct flight search tool  as far as i can tell it only lists departures
    from the airport you enter but if you click each departure there should be a reverse
    direction option which quickly links you to the departure schedule for the destination
    airport
  - i am 54 and roughly 256 the seatbelt fit around me ok but it does depend on the
    way your weight is distributed throughout your body southwest is pretty strict
    on making people buy a second seat if they are intruding on the person next to
    them i recently flew march 102017 and there was a guy on the plane who had to
    purchase a second ticket and he was given two seats it all depends on the way
    your body is shaped really i hope this at least helped a little bit for anyone
    that is reading this
- source_sentence: '[TITLE]how do i insist that american hotels accept my employers
    credit card for payment instead of asking for personal credit card upon checkin[BODY]pi
    work for a state government body in the united states as a part of my work i occasionally
    have multiday travel my hotel stays are paid by my employer and are taxexemptppi
    frequently run into a problem when paying for businessrelated hotels prior to
    travel my office files a form with hotels which is supposed to allow the hotel
    to charge my room to the offices credit card however inevitably when i check in
    each time the hotel clerk insists that i have to use my personal card this means
    that i have to temporarily cover the cost of my room until i am reimbursed but
    also that the state now has to pay taxes which is a poor use of taxpayer fundspphow
    can i get a hotel to accept my employers credit card for payment rather than insisting
    on using my personal cardp'
  sentences:
  - in my experience hotels will take a credit card at check in and put a hold on
    it but wont finalize the charge until near the end of the stay so you can give
    them a personal card and once youre in the room call the business office and have
    them sort it out with the hotel before you check out
  - officially the only reason youll need your old passport is if it contains any
    visas that are still current  despite being in the old passport these visas are
    generally still valid  if this is the case then obviously youll just want to carry
    your passport with you if you have no visas then the best advise i can give you
    is to put your old passport in one of your bags preferably one of the bags you
    checkin in the event that you lose your current passport  especially if in a foreign
    country  having your old passport will make the process of obtaining a replacement
    much easier personally i have my previous passport in an envelope containing some
    spare cash a spare atm card and an old drivers license  to date ive never needed
    any of these but its good to know they are there if i ever need them
  - 'generally trains in europe are either local or longdistance  the local ones sell
    tickets on the same day at the station and are fairly cheap  the longdistance
    ones offer much more comfort for a higher price and only between cities  i feel
    like 34 hours on a normal train is my limit and anything more than that and youll
    want something better some trains ie amsterdam  brussels run every day at the
    same time and you dont get a seat number  so you can get your ticket ahead of
    time and just show up and go on the day you want however the thalys and ice are
    the nicest and best trains but also priciest  the comfort is similar or better
    than that of an airplane  book early enough and you might get a nice discount  they
    often run specials available on their website  httpwwwthalyscom and httpwwwbahncomiviewusaentrainsoverviewiceshtml '
- source_sentence: '[TITLE]how do i politely refuse to lend my pen[BODY]pi use my
    pen on flights in plain sight for written work in generalppon one flight after
    seeing that i used it to complete customs forms my seatmate asked to borrow it
    to do the same i said yes as i enjoy helping others after my seatmate finished

  sentences:
  - i lived near kiel some years ago so i can suggest a few things with a big caveat
    i have no idea of what the current restrictions due to covid are for that check
    the other answers but this answer of mine might come useful in the future when
    hopefully the pandemic is over if you leave your luggage at the station and dont
    mind walking a bit you could have a bavarian dinner and have a good homemade beer
    at the kieler brauerei if you want to walk 15 minutes its a bit more than 1 km
    just follow the sophienblatt its where all the shops are its quite large so unless
    its a friday or saturday night it wont be too crowded and im sure the staff wont
    mind you occupying a table for long as there will be plenty of space for other
    customers if you dont want to walk that much i think the vapiano near the station
    is a good choice because if i remember correctly its a selfservice that is waiters
    wont come to your table you have to take a tray and walk to the counter to get
    something so if you stay for long at a table the staff will probably not mind
    they serve italian food nothing spectacular but its decent if you want to go to
    a pub there are many just pick one at random if you are into clubbing the nightlife
    area is the bergstrae  mostly between the pogue mahone and the subzero  there
    should be the luna currently closed due to covid and a few more otherwise closer
    to the station i remember the ben briggs  where everything is shipthemed check
    the pictures on google maps
  - just as another datum ive been involved in two emergency brake incidents in my
    life both on london underground tube services  in both i had no hesitation in
    concluding that the brake should be triggered and in the case when i myself tried
    to trigger it no penalty followed in that case a mother got on a busy tube train
    towing an unwilling child perhaps five years old at the last moment before the
    doors shut  the doors closed with the child mostly still outside holding the hand
    of his mother  his arm was thin enough that the rubber door edge strips compressed
    around it without triggering the something in the door detectors that would normally
    cause the doors to reopen automatically two others and i all reached for the emergency
    brakes whilst three other people grabbed the edges of the doors and attempted
    to force them open to relieve pressure on the childs arm  i have no idea which
    of us pulled the handle first but the driver got the message and the train either
    did not move off or immediately braked to a halt i cant recall which  both mother
    and child were extremely upset but unharmed
  - while reluctant to post yet another answer mine is different from everyone elses
    dont take out your pen and fill out the form right away  stall dont say anything
    dont make a big deal about it wait until the people sitting closest to you have
    figured out how they are going to fill out their forms if someone offers you a
    pen you can either decline and see if anyone else wants to use it or you can accept
    and never even take out your pen once those who are in your line of sight have
    at least started filling out their forms then take out your favorite pen and start
    working on yours the others are no longer in need of your pen so they wont ask
    to borrow it

  sentences:

    but in both countries its so rare that it shouldnt affect how you conduct yourself

    may well be some scary places in both countries where you feel conspicuous and
